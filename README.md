A secret word is chosen, and blanks () are shown for each letter.

Example: " _ _ _" for "STAR."

You have 7 chances of wrong guesses.

Take turns guessing one letter at a time. If correct, fill in the blanks.

Guess all letters before running out of guesses.

Hint: Words are space-related.

Good luck, astronaut! ðŸš€
